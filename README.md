- typescript is for development only 
- on the production we want to it to get transpiled to .js files , just like we have nodemon 
- npm i -D typescript //install typescript as a dev dependency <br/>
  //if we check in the node_modules tsc has files and scripts that is required to do <br/>
 //operations on the typescript files tsc script , transpile all the ts code to js by tsc(compiler)<br/>
